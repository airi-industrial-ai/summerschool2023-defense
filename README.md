This project was developed as a research thoughout summer school Airi 2023

This repository is dedicated to defense problem in a field of Fault Data Detection.
In this repository you can find baseline for FDD research: Models, Attacks and Defenders.
Models based on Dataset of Tennessee Eastman Process based on the paper Reinartz, C., Kulahci, M., & Ravn, O. (2021). An extended Tennessee Eastman simulation dataset for fault-detection and decision support systems. The dataset can be found in https://web.mit.edu/braatzgroup/links.html
The models:
 - [/notebooks/models](/notebooks/models)
 - MLP
 - GRU
 - Linear
The attack tools:
- [/notebooks/attacks](/notebooks/attacks)
- FGSM
- PGD
- DeepFool
The defendse tools:
